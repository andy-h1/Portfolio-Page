        After working 4 years as a neonatal nurse, I wanted to pursue my interest in the world of tech and started this journey working as a Tech recruiter for Arrows Group.
      </p>
      <p
        class="sc-AxhCb bOmpDp"
      >
        Working at Arrows Group gave me a thorough insight into how tech companies ran and the different specialities each company had. I was initially involved in hiring DevOps Engineers and transitioned into software engineering.
