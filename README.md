This is the repo for my current website which I am using as a playground to learn more about building React-based projects.

Common Scripts:
- yarn install dependencies
- yarn start run the project locally
- yarn test run the test suite
- yarn lint to lint the project
- yarn storybook run Storybook to see the component library

To Do:

- remove inline styles
- 404 page
- Add styled components to both Form and FormTracker
- Create function where you can update all fields, not just name
- Build inline editable UI
