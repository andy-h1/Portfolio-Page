This is the repo for my current website which I am using as a playground to learn more about building React-based projects.

Common Scripts:
- yarn install dependencies
- yarn start run the project locally
- yarn test run the test suite
- yarn lint to lint the project
- yarn storybook run Storybook to see the component library

To Do:

- add snapshot tests for every component
- remove inline styles
- handle errors
- 404 page
- write a test for `getWeatherImage`
- render weather project on home page
